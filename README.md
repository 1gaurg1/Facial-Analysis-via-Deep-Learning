# Facial analysis via deep learning

![](ModelTraining/final_gifs/0011000001001011.gif)

Our project focused on developing a deep learning model for detailed facial analysis and description. 
We aimed to create a system that could provide accurate descriptions of facial attributes, which could 
be useful in areas such as law enforcement, social media, and security, and recreate an image of a person 
based on footage. We recognised that traditional systems often struggle with unclear images, and the primary
motivation of our project was overcoming this.

The `FrontEnd` folder contains the SuspectAnalysis_WORKING jupyter notebook which imports our best classifier and
generator models, and puts them in a neat wrapper for the user. It also contains some examples of the output and 
a support folder of model data. 

The `ModelTraining` folder contains 3 ipynb files, each showing the model architecture and training loop of one of our 
models. Most of the other folders are there to support these. `Final_gifs` contains two examples of gifs generated by 
having each iteration of the model generate a face. Checkpointed models are in the `checkpoints` directory.
